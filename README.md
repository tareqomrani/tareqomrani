## Hi, I’m Tareq Omrani

I’m rebuilding my career with a focused specialization in **autonomous systems, AI engineering, UAV simulation, and cybersecurity**.  
My work explores how intelligent models, physics-based simulation, and secure system design come together to create the next generation of autonomous platforms.

I develop educational and research-grade tools that combine:

- ✈️ **Autonomous UAV modeling & aerodynamics**
- ⚙️ **Hybrid propulsion analysis & energy-aware mission planning**
- 🧠 **AI-driven reasoning layers using ChatGPT + prompt engineering**
- 🌐 **Navigation, sensor fusion, and mission logic**
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity principles applied to autonomous systems**
- 📡 **GNSS-denied navigation, compass variance, and risk modeling**

This portfolio reflects my broader transition into **AI-enabled autonomous systems** with an emphasis on technical depth, realism, and cybersecurity awareness.

## 🎯 Current Focus

- Advancing my **AI-enabled UAV simulation suite** (battery modeling, hybrid propulsion, IR/thermal risk, autonomous landing, drift simulation)
- Expanding my foundation in **robotics, control concepts, autonomy, and sensor fusion**
- Strengthening my technical background through ongoing **Coursera coursework** in:
  - Artificial Intelligence  
  - Machine Learning  
  - Cybersecurity (IBM Cybersecurity Analyst track)  
  - Cloud, Python, and advanced data concepts  
- Building practical projects that integrate:  
  **AI Engineering × Autonomous Systems × Cybersecurity**

---

## 🚀 Featured Work

- **UAV Battery Efficiency Estimator** — Physics-based modeling, hybrid systems, IR threat estimation  
- **VTOL Precision Landing Simulator** — LiDAR, RTK, MPC-style landing logic, playback animation  
- **Compass Variance & Drift Simulator** — Autonomous response logic to heading and magnetic error  
- **Autonomous Intelligence Networks (AIN)** — Exploration of multi-UAV coordination and distributed autonomy

Each project is designed with a focus on **realism, security considerations, and AI-assisted mission reasoning**.

## 🔐 Cybersecurity Background

Before pivoting into AI and autonomy, I worked in SaaS and B2B customer platforms supporting resilience, alerting systems, and operational security concerns.  
Today, I’m pairing that experience with:

- Network and systems security fundamentals  
- Threat analysis  
- Risk modeling  
- Detection logic  
- Real-world cybersecurity scenarios explored through Coursera and hands-on practice  

This gives my autonomy work a **security-first mindset**, which is increasingly critical for modern uncrewed systems.
