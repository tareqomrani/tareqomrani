### Hi, Iâ€™m Tareq Omrani

Iâ€™m rebuilding my tech career after a 3-year break â€” with a new focus on **cybersecurity and artificial intelligence**.

**Currently learning:**  
- Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate  
- IBM Cybersecurity Analyst  
- Google IT Support  
- IBM AI Engineering  
- Generative AI + Prompt Engineering  
- Machine Learning with Andrew Ng  

**Goals:**  
- Build real-world cybersecurity and AI projects  
- Share my work on GitHub and Notion  
- Transition into AI, cybersecurity, or trust/safety engineering
