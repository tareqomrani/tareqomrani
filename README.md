## Hi, I’m Tareq Omrani

I’m rebuilding my **tech career** with a focused specialization in **autonomous systems, AI engineering, UAV simulation, and cybersecurity**.  
My work explores how intelligent models, physics-based simulation, and secure system design come together to create the next generation of autonomous platforms.

A core part of my engineering philosophy is shaped by my years in **technical support and customer-facing operational roles**.  
That experience taught me that the most valuable tools are:

- **Easy to understand**  
- **Easy to operate**  
- **Hard to misuse**  
- **Impossible to outgrow**

This mindset guides everything I build: **high-utility systems wrapped in clean, intuitive interfaces.**

---

I develop educational and research-grade tools that combine:

- ✈️ **Autonomous UAV modeling & aerodynamics**
- ⚙️ **Hybrid propulsion analysis & energy-aware mission planning**
- 🧠 **AI-driven reasoning layers using ChatGPT + prompt engineering for modeling and simulation**
- 🌐 **Navigation, sensor fusion, and mission logic**
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity principles applied to autonomous systems**
- 📡 **GNSS-denied navigation, compass variance, and risk modeling**

This portfolio reflects my broader transition into **AI-enabled autonomous systems**, including work on **Autonomous UAV Networks**, with an emphasis on technical depth, realism, and cybersecurity awareness.

## 🎯 Current Focus

- Advancing my **AI-enabled UAV simulation suite**, including:
  - Battery & hybrid propulsion modeling  
  - Multirotor (quad) energy modeling  
  - IR/thermal risk estimation  
  - Autonomous landing & approach logic  
  - Drift & compass variance simulation  
- Expanding my foundation in **robotics, control concepts, autonomy, and sensor fusion**
- Strengthening my technical background through ongoing **Coursera coursework** in:
  - Artificial Intelligence  
  - Machine Learning  
  - Cybersecurity (IBM Cybersecurity Analyst track)  
  - Cloud, Python, and advanced data concepts  
- Building practical projects that integrate:  
  **AI Engineering × Autonomous Systems × Cybersecurity**

## 🔐 Cybersecurity Background

Before pivoting deeper into AI and autonomy, I worked extensively in **SaaS and B2B support environments**, managing real-time alerting, uptime, customer workflows, and operational reliability.  
This background directly informs my approach to engineering:

- **Reliability first**  
- **Clarity in design**  
- **Secure-by-default architecture**  
- **Anticipate failure modes, not users**  
- **Build tools that real operators can trust**

I continue developing this mindset through ongoing cybersecurity coursework and real-world attack/defense modeling.
